# Bonsai — Milestone TODO

> Single source of truth for session resume. Keep the "Current step:" line of the
> in-progress milestone updated at every workflow transition.

Environment: Rust 1.97.1 stable-msvc, VS Build Tools 2022 17.14, pnpm 11.17.0, Node 24, WebView2.
Cargo not on default PATH — `$HOME/.cargo/bin`. Browser harness: `pnpm dev:mock` (port 1420).
Avoid tauri "test" feature on this machine (STATUS_ENTRYPOINT_NOT_FOUND); use runtime-free
inner functions for command tests.
**USER MANDATE (2026-07-28): never use C: for temp/scratch/mock repos — C: is critically full.
Use `D:\Temp\bonsai-scratch`; when running cargo tests set TMP/TEMP to `D:\Temp` (tempfile
honors them). Include this in every subagent prompt that runs tests or creates repos.**

## M0 — Scaffold — **done** (2026-07-27)

AI gate passed (cargo test 6/6 + CLI cross-check, clippy, pnpm build, browser harness live incl.
mock isolation); USER CHECKPOINT confirmed by user: all 5 checklist items pass in `pnpm tauri dev`.
Contract: docs/contracts/M0-scaffold.md. Sub-increments: c090459, 0cd1d4d, b60fc36, a3cfadd.

## M1 — Working-directory status — **done** (2026-07-27)

AI gate passed (29/29 tests incl. 14 porcelain oracle, watcher 3× stable, builds, live harness);
USER CHECKPOINT confirmed by user: watcher auto-update, CLI git add, refresh button, refocus
rescan, bare-repo banner all pass. Contract: docs/contracts/M1-status.md.
Sub-increments: ee3bb52, 65c6c73, 04a87df, a87a41e.

## M2 — Commit graph (centerpiece; M2a–M2d) — **done** (2026-07-28)

AI gate passed (46 tests + 2 release perf gates: layout 317ms/500 limit, serialize 10ms/5.44MB,
sweep maxWindow5Avg 23.6ms over100=0, harness renders verified). USER CHECKPOINT confirmed by
user: scrolling the 31k fixture repo feels smooth in the native app, all checklist items pass.
Contract: docs/contracts/M2-graph.md. Sub-increments: cfba129, cccbb2f, 5ad41a6, d2a6cf5, 8ed7807.
Perf notes: relax_odb_hash_verification() at app init; wire 5.44MB@31k (streaming fallback
documented §8.2 if ever needed); regression lever = cached repo handle in AppState. Perf notes: mempack fixture gen;
strict_hash_verification(false) global opt-out needed for <500ms; next lever if regression =
cached repo handle in AppState. Polish candidates: refresh-failure alignment, frame-log tagging.
WARNING: C: drive ~0 bytes free — flag to user.

Goal: Rust computes GraphLayout from a commit walk seeded from all local branches,
remote-tracking branches, and tags; topological-then-date ordering; deterministic lane colors
stable while scrolling; React renders GitKraken-style canvas graph (curved fork/merge edges,
commit dots, ref pills incl. HEAD/detached), virtualized to visible rows. Sub-increments:
- M2a — layout engine + unit tests (pure Rust, no UI)
- M2b — canvas rendering of a static precomputed layout (harness screenshot)
- M2c — virtualization, scrolling, ref pills, HiDPI canvas scaling
- M2d — perf gate: fixture generator + criterion benchmark

Acceptance (AI gate): lane/edge unit tests on tricky fixture histories; harness screenshots show
correct lanes/curves/dots/pills; synthetic 20k+ commit fixture built via git2 or fast-import
(NOT CLI commits); criterion layout < 500 ms for 20k commits; harness scroll test logs rAF frame
timings with no sustained frames > 33 ms.
Acceptance (USER CHECKPOINT): scrolling the 20k repo in the native app feels smooth.

## M3 — Stage / unstage / commit — **done** (2026-07-28)

AI gate passed (80 tests incl. 18 CLI-oracle + 3 adversarial; CRLF normalization fixed; harness
round-trip verified). USER CHECKPOINT confirmed by user: stage/unstage/commit round-trip works
in the native app, all checklist items pass. Contract: docs/contracts/M3-commit.md.
Sub-increments: ab0f943, 2ce24be, e484daa.
Polish notes: textarea disabled during stage-in-flight (focus drop); dismissed-error
string-compare; ignored-file staging = git add -f semantics (documented).

## M4 — Diff view — **in-progress**

Current step: M4b — implemented + live-verified by dev (24/24 CDP checks both modes);
awaiting reviewer round 1. M4a committed (3ab213a).

Goal: via git2, working-dir diffs (unstaged vs index, staged vs HEAD) AND commit diffs
(selected graph node vs first parent, with commit details — message/author/date — in the right
panel). Unified or side-by-side per architect.

Acceptance (AI gate): diff output matches `git diff` / `git show` in tests; harness renders
both diff kinds from mock data.
Acceptance (USER CHECKPOINT): selecting a commit in the graph shows its details + changes in
the native app.
